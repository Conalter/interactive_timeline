# Historical Timeline React Project
## The History of Ancient Rome
The Roman republic and empire, from rise and fall, spans a period of over 2000 years. It is a complicated drama with a massive cast of characters. One can very easily get bogged down in the details and chronology of events. I love history but I hate dates. The chronological order of the 71 Roman Empires is of little interest to anyones - but the intrigues and wars of those very same emperors, politicians and military leaders is fascinating!

There is a map showing the borders of the Roman empire, which dynamically updates depending on the position of the timeline - as well as a changing background, which displays a painting of depicting an idealised version of the current epoch.

## Technical Details
The purpose of this app is to clearly convey the history of the Romans in a way that is both fun and educational.

The dates are drawn from Wikipedia's API and plotted on an auto-scrolling timeline at the top of the page.

The buttons displayed on the page allow users to jump to specific points on the map, favourite interesting events, and add notes to saved events.

The app is build in Javascript using React. It was built during project week at CodeClan Glasgow.

All features are modular and reusable in later projects. The Wikipedia API has been made to work with our project but irregularities in user-inputed data on Wikipedia means that aspect is not particularly stable (at least for porting over different timelines).

## Enjoy
