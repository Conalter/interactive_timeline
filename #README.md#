# Interactive Timeline
An interactive timeline of Roman history, built
The brief for this project was to create an Educational app, which shows information in an interactive way.

Using data from the Wikipedia API, this web app displays the events of Roman History in a horizontal timeline. Users can favourite specific events, and add notes to them. These save into local storage.

There is a map showing the borders of the Roman empire, which dynamically updates depending on the position of the timeline - as well as a changing background, which displays a painting of the current era.
